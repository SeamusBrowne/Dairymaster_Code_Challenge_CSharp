Endpoints include:\
getBooks - GET, Shows a list of books.\
createbook - POST, Creates a book and sets the status.\
publishbook - PATCH, Publishes a selected book and sets the date.\
listbooks - GET, List all books with publication status.\

Why I chose my design:\
My main thinking process was to link the work of the project to the criteria of what I believe I would be dealing with in the company, so that is why I chose a minimal API approach. Presumably, minimal APIs are better suited for equipment which are remote with little connectivity and that run locally i.e. Farming software. I anticipate a lot of work with microservices which is also why I chose this method as they are favoured.\

Project isn't very complex, so a minimal API is adequate. Whilst I have done controller-based projects before, I believe minimal APIs are better for systems with a lot of constraints and resource limits.\


In a real-world environment, the program would be a lot more robust with other data and functionality, but I kept it inline with the scope of the document as much as possible.\
